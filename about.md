<h2>hi&#9786 i'm Anne Breen. i write horror fiction.</h2>
<h4>welcome to this website.</h4>
<p>'Anne' is actually my middle name - but I've always the uncanny feeling I shouldn't publish fiction under my first one. Impossible to say why. As long as it doesn't cause harm, it's good to follow gut feelings IMO.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a brief introduction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perth, West Australia</li>
<li>music addict</li>
<li>wlw</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was a kid someone asked me, "What do you want to be when you grow up?", to which I replied, "An author!" Maybe because I'd read a book once.</p>
<p>Then I realized it'd be super embarrasing to not try and follow through. That's the origin story I usually give.</p>
<p>Truthfully, though, I've got no idea, really. The earliest one was about a world called 'Limmerlops' which was entirely blue after a wizard cursed it, and if you said the wizard's name you went insane. Also cars randomly flew there. I was ten.</p>
<p>'Limmerlops' sounds like some kind of dish. Fitting. Those papers got eaten by white ants.</p>
<p>These days I'm, like, a grown-up or something. That's what they tell me. I still love writing. Not much gives me more satisfaction.</p>
<p>Also horror is the funnest genre because, well, I have my theories. Maybe I'll write them in a post.</p>

<p>This isn't exactly the most interesting page on the internet, I'll admit. To be honest, there isn't a wealth of content to post here. The plan is to add more as years go by.</p>
<p>For now, let me fill it up with some pictures of my true love, Boris:</p>
